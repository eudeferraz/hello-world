Getting Started

Hello, I'm just getting started studying Git and learning more about GitHub.
I'm really interested to learn other programming languages, cause I just know a few ones, like Java, HTML, javascript, and CSS.
I fell that it's not enough and I want to learn more, my English is not that good too but I'm trying to improve it.
